            Superman, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, debuted in Action Comics #1 in 1938 and is one of the most iconic superheroes. He hails from the planet Krypton, where he was born as Kal-El. His parents, Jor-El and Lara, sent him to Earth as a baby when Krypton was about to be destroyed. He was found and raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent in Smallville, Kansas, and took on the name Clark Kent. As he grew up, Clark discovered he had superhuman abilities due to Earth’s yellow sun, such as super strength, speed, flight, x-ray vision, and heat vision. He adopts the superhero identity of Superman and fights for truth, justice, and peace.

Other notable villains include Brainiac, an alien android obsessed with collecting knowledge, and Doomsday, the monstrous being who famously killed Superman in the 1990s comic storyline, The Death of Superman.
